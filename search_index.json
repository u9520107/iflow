Documents\n\nIntroduction\nBasics\nAdvanced\nAPI\nTips\nReact\nFAQ\n\nBenefits\n\nKeep the data structure primitive\n\niFlow because of the proxy mechanism, it retains the primitive nature of the data structure while supporting asynchronous functions as well as other types of functions, including, of course, ordinary classes and functions.\n\nNo boilerplate code\n\niFlow can give you more freedom to use it to implement a state data structure that is in line with the actual development needs, and not to have too many boilerplate code because of the limitations of various libraries.\n\nBe easy to OOP\n\nSometimes when we need decoupled business code, we may need some object-oriented programming when design, so the State Library is better if it can support it.\n\nAs few selectors as possible\n\nWhen using a web framework such as react, the corresponding connection library react-iflow allows you to write and manipulate as few selectors as possible.\n\nPowerful middleware\n\nIf necessary, in fact iflow is powerful and useful, and you can use it to implement a variety of coupled business codes.\n\nComposable and scalable store\n\niFlow advocates the store group to synthesize the store tree without worrying about the performance impact of the unrelated store, because it is dynamically matched and you can be assured of free combination and expansion of the store.\nLimitations and pitfalls\n\nUnable to automate batch update within dispatcher\n\nFor the action of a normal synchronization process, the merge problem with the same state being changed multiple times is ignored and we will fix it.\n\nComputed not implemented\n\nWe consider implementing standard observable to complete computed, or implementing non-standard immutable patterns to cache derivative computations.\n\nProxy/Reflect polyfill not supported\n\nSince IE11 does not support ES6 Proxy/Reflect, we will consider adding Proxy/Reflect polyfill to support IE11.\n\nImmutable not supported\n\nA sub-component that is connected to the state component is iFlow, and the shouldComponentUpdate API within its sub-component will not be able to be judged for update control if it is used in the iFlow of the parent component.\n\nA prototype chain function injection of a primitive type that does not support native proxy cannot trigger notification of these types of change behavior automatically\n\nCurrently known unsupported types are: Set / WeakSet / Map / WeakMap, and soon we will support it.\nSupport and

Principles","keywords":"","body":"Concepts Principles\n\nAfter using some state management libraries or containers, I always feel that there should be a new state management library, although it is a mutable structure, but it should be able to maintain the state of the original data type, it also supports immutable, while taking into account mutable for programming and operation, And it should be incremental, not disruptive to programming fun because of too much cumbersome operations, such as deconstruction spread Operator, and other complex concepts.\n\nTherefore, iFlow attempts to build a new state management library based on paths match using Proxy & Reflect of ECMAScript 2015. What needs to be specifically stated is that the iFlow definition store is comprised of actions and state.\n\nPaths Match\n\nThe Getter Paths is obtained when the view component is referencing the state of the store, and the setter Path is obtained by proxy when the action is triggered.

Of course, By default, these middleware are not set up and used, and are not entered into these middleware's. By default, the state notification change used by the corresponding view is changed based on each state change, not the action at the end of each execution, and of course, we also provide batch API to batch update state changes.\n\nState Reference procedure\n\nThe state of the store is processed by the selector (if there is a setting) and then through the connector, which is then inserted into the view component.\nHow to work\n\n\n\nFormula to express is: action (store) => store = newStore\n\n\nWelcome to use iFlow!&#x1F389;&#x1F389;&#x1F389;\n"},"docs/introduction/Benefits.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/Benefits.html","title":"Benefits","keywords":"","body":"Benefits\n\nKeep the data structure primitive\n\niFlow because of the proxy mechanism, it retains the primitive nature of the data structure while supporting asynchronous functions as well as other types of functions, including, of course, ordinary classes and functions.\n\nNo boilerplate code\n\niFlow can give you more freedom to use it to implement a state data structure that is in line with the actual development needs, and not to have too many boilerplate code because of the limitations of various libraries.\n\nBe easy to OOP\n\nSometimes when we need decoupled business code, we may need some object-oriented programming when design, so the State Library is better if it can support it.\n\nAs few selectors as possible\n\nWhen using a web framework such as react, the corresponding connection library react-iflow allows you to write and manipulate as few selectors as possible.\n\nPowerful middleware\n\nIf necessary, in fact iflow is powerful and useful, and you can use it to implement a variety of coupled business codes.\n\nComposable and scalable store\n\niFlow advocates the store group to synthesize the store tree without worrying about the performance impact of the unrelated store, because it is dynamically matched and you can be assured of free combination and expansion of the store.\n"},"docs/introduction/Examples.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/Examples.html","title":"Examples: Counter","keywords":"","body":"Examples\nCounter\nimport React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom'\nimport iFlow from 'iflow'\nimport flow from 'react-iflow'\n\nconst pipe = iFlow({\n  calculate (number) {\n    this.counter += number\n  },\n  counter: 0,\n})\n\nconst store = pipe.create()\n\nconst Counter = flow(store)(class extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n        \n         this.props.store.calculate(-1)}>-\n        {this.props.store.counter}\n         this.props.store.calculate(1)}>+\n      \n    );\n  }\n})\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  ,\n  document.getElementById('app')\n)\n\nOnline\nWe'll refer to another Todo example later in this chapter.\n"},"docs/basics/":{"url":"docs/basics/","title":"Basics","keywords":"","body":"Basics\nIf you have just contacted the state Management library, then you can also quickly use iFlow to be a complete program; Of course, if you use the experience of the state Management library, then iFlow can use some advanced interfaces to design some architectures that are not well implemented by other libraries, And you may be pleasantly surprised to discover that iFlow has some of the most popular features of the State Library that are not well implemented.\nFor ease of description, we define the store including state and actions, and the uninitialized store we call Pipe.\nThe following basic tutorials will step you through the development of simple TODO applications.\n\nState\nAction\nPipe\nStore\nExamples: TODO\n\n"},"docs/basics/State.html":{"url":"docs/basics/State.html","title":"State","keywords":"","body":"State\nThis section should be the simplest part, because iFlow supports many modes of state design, which was originally designed.\nFor example, you can write a todo state in object mode.\nimport iFlow from 'iflow'\nconst pipe = iFlow({\n  todo:[],\n  tabStatus: 'All',\n})\n\nOr use the ES6 class to implement it.\nimport iFlow from 'iflow'\n\nclass Todo {\n  constructor (){\n    this.list = []\n    this.tabStatus = 'All'\n  }\n}\n\nconst pipe = iFlow(new Todo)\n\nOf course, in order to correlate the structural coupling of variables, we usually also write some static state on the above to facilitate management, for example:\n\nAdd on Object\n\nimport iFlow from 'iflow'\n\nconst pipe = iFlow({\n  todo:[],\n  tabStatus: 'All',\n  tabs: [\n     'All',\n     'Active',\n     'Completed'\n   ]\n})\n\n\nAdd to Class\n\nimport iFlow from 'iflow'\n\nclass Todo {\n  constructor (){\n    this.list = []\n    this.tabStatus = 'All'\n    this.tabs = [\n        'All',\n        'Active',\n        'Completed'\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nconst pipe = iFlow(new Todo())\n\nHow, is not very simple.

In this section, let's implement the actions of the TODO state.\n\nFor the action Modify node state to be referenced to the current node, there are two modes, which are the this of the non-arrow function and the self of the arrow function.\nIf the iFlow action is a non-arrow function, then the internal pipe node is represented by this\nFor example:\nconst pipe = iFlow({\n  test: 0,\n  testAction(foobar) {\n    this.test += foobar\n  }\n})\n\niFlow action if the arrow function, then the internal pipe node with the tail parameter self representation\n例如\nconst pipe = iFlow({\n  test: 0,\n  testAction:(foobar, self) => {\n    self.test += foobar\n  }\n})\n\niFlow supports a variety of functional notation:\nFor example, to add an action on the TODO state management structure under an object structure:\nimport iFlow from 'iflow'\n\nconst pipe = iFlow({\n    todo: [],\n    tabStatus: 'All',\n    tabs: [\n        'All',\n        'Active',\n        'Completed'\n    ],\n    add (text) {\n        this.list.push({\n            id: +new Date(),\n            text,\n            completed: false,\n        })\n    }\n})\n\nIf it's class structure,\nimport iFlow from 'iflow'\n\nclass Todo {\n  constructor (){\n    this.list = []\n    this.tabStatus = 'All'\n    this.tabs = [\n        'All',\n        'Active',\n        'Completed'\n    ]\n  }\n  add (text) {\n      this.list.push({\n          id: +new Date(),\n          text,\n          completed: false,\n      })\n  }\n}\n\nconst pipe = iFlow(new Todo())\n\nAn action function this refers to the current pipe scope this, in fact it is the same as a native JavaScript. It should be noted that At the same time a single action can have more than one state of synchronization changes, and each change will be a view of the status update, if you need an action to update only a number of synchronized changes, you can use batch API so that it performs an update.\nAnd then we've got the next few action.\nimport iFlow from 'iflow'\n\nconst pipe = iFlow({\n    todo: [],\n    tabStatus: 'All',\n    tabs: [\n        'All',\n        'Active',\n        'Completed'\n    ],\n    add (text) {\n        this.list.push({\n            id: +new Date(),\n            text,\n            completed: false,\n        })\n    },\n    toggleTodo (currentId) {\n        const current = this.list.find(({id}) => id === currentId)\n        current.completed = !current.completed\n    },\n\n    clearCompleted () {\n        this.list = this.list.filter(({completed}) => !completed)\n    },\n\n    toggleTab (tabStatus) {\n        this.tabStatus = tabStatus\n    }\n})\n\nTo describe simplicity, subsequent chapters will no longer describe the pipe structure design using the class structure.\n"},"docs/basics/Pipe.html":{"url":"docs/basics/Pipe.html","title":"Pipe","keywords":"","body":"Pipe\nIn fact, in the last section we have completed all the pipe setup work, which contains the initial state settings and action settings.\nHowever, pipe can actually contain functions that are not directly related to state changes, such as adding a onSubmit function to the pipe completed in the previous section, which will be used directly for the onSubmit event of the form associated with the Add button.\nimport iFlow from 'iflow'\n\nconst pipe = iFlow({\n    todo: [],\n    tabStatus: 'All',\n    tabs: [\n        'All',\n        'Active',\n        'Completed'\n    ],\n    add (text) {\n        this.list.push({\n            id: +new Date(),\n            text,\n            completed: false,\n        })\n    },\n    toggleTodo (currentId) {\n        const current = this.list.find(({id}) => id === currentId)\n        current.completed = !current.completed\n    },\n\n    clearCompleted () {\n        this.list = this.list.filter(({completed}) => !completed)\n    },\n\n    toggleTab (tabStatus) {\n        this.tabStatus = tabStatus\n    },\n    onSubmit (e, input) {\n        e.preventDefault()\n        if (!!input.value.trim()) {\n          this.add(input.value)\n          input.value = ''\n        }\n    }\n})\n\nOf course, if it is for pipe state management to be pure and without side effects, we also suggest that onSubmit be written in the relevant view component to maintain the existence and independence of the state management design.\n⚠️⚠️Note:\npipe initialization (create) becomes a store, but before pipe is initialized (create), we can append the corresponding middleware to the pipe.
